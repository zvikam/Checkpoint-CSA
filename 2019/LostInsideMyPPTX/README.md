## problem
given a set of powerpoint presentations, we need to extract a key from the slides.
## solver
we don't like to do it manually.  
- extract all the slides from the pptx files (which are just fancy zip files) 
- extract all the text
- staring with the START presentation, parse the text to find the next step (pptx file and slide)
